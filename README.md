# Public_MyAnimeMatch
For the things that might be improved upon that I didn't have time/will/the means to do:

1-Adding multi-site comparission:
  If a site like AniDb ever releases an Api where we can get the user_list, they can be implamented to the system with ease. But I doubt that will happen since every single site seems to have stopped working on their Api, even Mal. 

2-Adding favourites to the evulation:
  I don't know if Api can result into the favoruite list for the user, but even if it can, it's really hard to store that in a database since there is countless People/Characters that can be favourited. I'm using the cheapest database-web hosting combo out there, and with that I don't see my app surviving a favourited loop... If you have money tho.............

3-Grouping users differently if they actually use the "dropped" feature:
  Some users don't record the animes they drop on the first few eps, which obviously effects their average rating. I originally wanted to divide these groups, hence why the weird 2 of the same columns in "Users_info" file, but kinda gave up on it. I guess it would work slighlty better than this current system? It would be better at emphasizing average rating, I am sure about that. 


Side Note:
  I learned Css and Html with this project, coding overall as well probably. So yeah, I know there are so many inefficient parts, I didn't bother to fix them for the 3844789489347th time.
